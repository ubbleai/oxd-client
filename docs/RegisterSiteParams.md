**jwks** | **str** | Client&#39;s JSON Web Key Set (JWK) document, passed by value. The semantics of the jwks parameter are the same as the jwks_uri parameter, other than that the JWK Set is passed by value, rather than by reference. This parameter is intended only to be used by Clients that, for some reason, are unable to use the jwks_uri parameter, for instance, by native applications that might not have a location to host the contents of the JWK Set. If a Client can use jwks_uri, it must not use jwks. One significant downside of jwks is that it does not enable key rotation. The jwks_uri and jwks parameters must not be used together. | [optional]

**default_max_age** | **int** | specifies the Default Maximum Authentication Age. | [optional] 
**require_auth_time** | **bool** | specifies the Boolean value specifying whether the auth_time claim in the id_token is required. It is required when the value is true. The auth_time claim request in the request object overrides this setting. | [optional]
